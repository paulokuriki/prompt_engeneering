# Radiology Report Classification with Large Language Models

## Overview
This project demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist in classifying radiology reports. By leveraging prompt engineering techniques, the notebook guides users through different classification approaches, including:

- **Zero-shot classification**
- **Few-shot classification**
- **Condition-specific classification**

## Running the Notebook
The notebook is designed to run on **Google Colab** for ease of use. It includes all necessary dependencies and setup instructions to ensure a smooth execution.

You can access the notebook directly from this repository: [Prompt Engineering Notebook](https://github.com/paulokuriki/prompt_engeneering/blob/main/prompt_engeneering.ipynb).

## Key Features
- Uses **LangChain** and **OpenAI's GPT models** for text classification.
- Provides structured methods for analyzing and categorizing radiology reports.
- Supports classification for general abnormalities and specific medical conditions.

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**.
2. Follow the instructions to install dependencies.
3. Load the dataset and run the classification models.
4. Modify the templates to create custom classifiers.

## Dataset Reference
This project utilizes an open-access chest X-ray collection from **Indiana University**, sourced from the **OpenI repository** (OpenI). The dataset contains labeled radiology reports that help in training and evaluating classification models.
